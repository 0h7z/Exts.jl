@doc """
	LDict <- LittleDict

An ordered dictionary type for small numbers of keys. Rather than using
`hash` or some other sophisticated measure to store the vals in a clever
arrangement, it just keeps everything in a pair of lists.

While theoretically this has expected time complexity ``O(n)`` (vs the
hash-based [`OrderedDict`](@ref ODict)/`Dict`'s expected time complexity
``O(1)``, and the search-tree-based `SortedDict`'s expected time complexity
``O(\\log n)``), in practice it is really fast, because it is cache & SIMD
friendly.

It is reasonable to expect it to outperform an `OrderedDict`, with up to
around 30 elements in general; or with up to around 50 elements if using a
`LittleDict` backed by `Tuple`s (see [`freeze`](@ref)). However, this depends
on exactly how long `isequal` and `hash` take, as well as on how many hash
collisions occur etc.

!!! note

	When constructing a `LittleDict` it is faster to pass in the keys and values
	each as separate lists. So if you have them seperately already, do
	`LittleDict(ks, vs)` not `LittleDict(zip(ks, vs))`. Furthermore, key and
	value lists that are passed as `Tuple`s will not require any copies to create
	the `LittleDict`, so `LittleDict(ks::Tuple, vs::Tuple)` is the fastest
	constructor of all.

!!! warning

	When constructing a `LittleDict`, unlike hash-based `OrderedDict`/`Dict`, it
	does not guarantee that the keys are unique but assumes so. Use at your own
	risk if there might be duplicate keys.
