@doc """
	LDict <- LittleDict

An ordered dictionary type for small numbers of keys. Rather than using
`hash` or some other sophisticated measure to store the vals in a clever
arrangement, it just keeps everything in a pair of lists.

While theoretically this has expected time complexity ``O(n)`` (vs the
hash-based `OrderedDict`/`Dict`'s expected time complexity ``O(1)``, and the
search-tree-based `SortedDict`'s expected time complexity ``O(\\log n)``), in
practice it is really fast, because it is cache & SIMD friendly.

It is reasonable to expect it to outperform an `OrderedDict`, with up to
around 30 elements in general; or with up to around 50 elements if using a
`LittleDict` backed by `Tuple`s. However, this depends on exactly how long
`isequal` and `hash` take, as well as on how many hash collisions occur etc.

The order refers to insertion order, which allows deterministic iteration
over the dictionary.
